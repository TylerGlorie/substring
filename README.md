# substring

The Problem:

for an n amount of sets of strings

Given a sequence of letters and a subsequence, the program counts how many times the particular subsequence occurs.

------------------------------------------------------------

The Input:

The first line of the input will contain a single positive integer, n, representing the number of test cases in the file. The following n lines will contain 1 non-empty string each. The first of these strings is the given input sequence while the second string will be the subsequence for which to search. It is guaranteed that the length of the first string is 1000 or less and that the length of the subsequence is less than or equal to the length of the given sequence. Furthermore, itâ€™s guaranteed that the subsequence appears at least once in the sequence.

The Output:
For each set of strings, outputs a single line with the number of occurrences of the given subsequence. The program supports values up to 10^18.
